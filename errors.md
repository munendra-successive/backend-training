<h2>Error Code: 400</h2>

**Description:**
Bad Request

**Meaning:**
The HTTP 400 status code indicates that the server cannot process the request due to a client error. This error typically occurs when the server cannot understand or process the request due to invalid syntax, missing parameters, or incorrect data formatting in the request.

**Possible Causes:**
Missing required parameters: The request is missing some necessary parameters or information that the server needs to process it.

**Incorrect syntax in the request:** The structure or syntax of the request (e.g., JSON formatting, query parameters) is incorrect or does not follow the expected standards.

**Invalid data format:** The data provided in the request does not match the expected format or type.

<h2>Error Code: 404</h2>

**Description:**
Not Found

**Meaning:**
The HTTP 404 status code indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource. This error occurs when the server cannot locate the URL or resource specified in the request.

**Possible Causes:**
Incorrect URL or endpoint: The URL provided in the request does not match any known resource on the server.

**Resource moved, deleted, or doesn't exist:** The requested resource has been moved to a different location, deleted, or was never present on the server.

<h2>Error Code: 500</h2>

**Description:**
Internal Server Error

**Meaning:**
The HTTP 500 status code is a generic error message indicating that an unexpected condition occurred on the server, and the server cannot fulfill the request.

**Possible Causes:**

**Server misconfiguration:** Configuration settings on the server are incorrect or incompatible, leading to errors when processing requests.

**Software bugs or issues:** Errors in the server's software code or applications cause unexpected behavior or crashes.

**Database errors:** Issues with the server's database connection, queries, or data manipulation can result in this error.

<h2>Error Code: 500</h2>

**Description:**
Service Unavailable

**Meaning:**
The HTTP 503 status code indicates that the server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance.

**Possible Causes:**

**Server overload:** The server is handling too many requests at once, surpassing its capacity to respond.
**Scheduled maintenance:** The server is undergoing maintenance, and normal service is temporarily unavailable.
Network issues: Problems with the server's network connection prevent it from servicing requests.

<h2>Error Code: 401</h2>

**Description:**
Unauthorized

**Meaning:**
The HTTP 401 status code indicates that the request lacks valid authentication credentials or the user does not have permission to access the resource.

**Possible Causes:**

**Missing or invalid authentication tokens:** The user or client making the request lacks the necessary authentication credentials or provided invalid ones.

**Insufficient permissions:** The user does not have the necessary permissions or privileges to access the requested resource.

**Expired or revoked access credentials:** The authentication tokens or credentials have expired, been revoked, or are no longer valid.

<h2>Error Code: 403</h2>

**Description:**
Forbidden

**Meaning:**
The HTTP 403 status code indicates that the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it. The client does not have permission to access the requested resource.

**Possible Causes:**

**Insufficient permissions:** Similar to 401, the user does not have sufficient permissions or access rights to view or modify the requested resource.

**Access forbidden by server configuration:** Server settings or access control configurations explicitly deny access to the requested resource for the user or client making the request.
