<h2>Client-Server Architecture </h2>
Client-server architecture is a computing model where tasks or workloads are divided between servers and clients. Below is the detailed explanation

<h4>1. Components:</h4> This architecture comprises two main components:

- **Server:** The server hosts and manages resources, services, or data. It responds to requests from clients by providing resources or performing computations.

- **Client:** The client is a device or software application that requests services or resources from the server. It initiates communication with the server and uses the provided services or data to perform tasks.

<h4>2. Communication:</h4> Clients and servers communicate through a network using protocols like HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP, etc. The client sends requests to the server, which processes these requests and sends back responses containing the requested information or services.

<h4>3. Responsibilities:</h4>

- **Server Responsibilities:** Servers are responsible for managing resources, executing services, storing data, and processing requests from clients. They usually have higher processing power, storage capacity, and reliability compared to clients.
- **Client Responsibilities:** Clients interact with users and initiate requests to the server. They are responsible for presenting data or services to users and may have user interfaces that allow users to interact with the system.


<h4>4. Types of Servers:</h4>

   - **File Servers:** Store and manage files, allowing clients to access and manipulate these files remotely.
   - **Web Servers:** Host websites and web applications, responding to client requests for web pages or services.
   - **Database Servers:** Store and manage databases, handling client requests for data retrieval, modification, or deletion.
   - **Application Servers:** Run specific applications or services that clients can access and utilize.


<h4>5. Advantages:</h4>

   - **Centralization:** Centralized servers allow for better management, security, and control of resources and data.
   - **Scalability:** Servers can be scaled up or out to handle increased demand from multiple clients.
   - **Resource Sharing:** Servers enable efficient sharing of resources among multiple clients, reducing redundancy and improving resource utilization.


<h4>6. Disadvantages:</h4>

   - **Single Point of Failure:** If the server fails, it can disrupt services for multiple clients.
   - **Network Dependency:** Clients heavily rely on network connections; network issues can affect communication with the server.
   - **Load Balancing:** Proper load balancing is necessary to distribute client requests evenly among servers to avoid performance bottlenecks.
